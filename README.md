# myLittleWorld

Hi there! I'm Yanai, and I'm very bored, so I decided to try and create a little animated world to learn a bit multithreading and animation, and perhaps even physics. I regret it already...

If you see this, I assume I sent you the repository, so feel free to view the code, perhaps optimize some or even add new features (:
new branch just in case
